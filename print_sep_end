# examples of sep and end in parentheses
# notes to myself; When you type more than one expression in print(), you notice that the expressions are joined to each other by spaces. 
# This is due to the default value of keyword argument sep in the print() function. 
# This argument, which is defined as a space üëâüèª" " by default, is not visible in the background in the print().
# The print() command automatically switches to the next line. This is due to the keyword argument end = "\n"
# Here are the keyword arguments that run in the background of the print() function :
# print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
# \n examples

                                       # So that we had empty line.
